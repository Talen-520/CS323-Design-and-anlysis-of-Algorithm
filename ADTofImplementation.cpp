//Linked-list implementation of Stack, Queue, and ordered list.
/*
What your program need to do as follow:
1) Build a stack: a) open an input file; b) read one data at the time from the input file; c) create a new node with data; d)
push (newNode), on top of the stack.
2) Build a queue: a) pop the stack; b) print the data in the node to outFile1, c) insertQ (node), at the back of the queue.
3) Build a list: a) delete a node from the front of the queue; b) print the data in the node to outFile2, c) insertLL (node) to
the list, in ascending order.
4) Print list: a) print the entire list from the beginning to the end of the list to outFile3.
Note: You must use argv to open input file and 3 output files. -5 points deduction if you hard-code your file names!
